#FORK: Provide support for Sublime Text SFTP configuration JSON file

Sublime SFTP: https://wbond.net/sublime_packages/sftp

This repo is unlikely to be kept up-to-date, but by all means you're welcome to drop any issues and I may be able to help. Alternatively, check the [original source Repo](https://github.com/amoussard/sftp-deployment).

What can this repo do?

* Support Sublime SFTP config file `sftp-config.json`
* Support Sublime SFTP config keys

This repo doesn't provide many of the features that Sublime SFTP provides and just simply acts as a bridge between Atom.io/Sublime git projects.
